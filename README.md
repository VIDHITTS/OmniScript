# Personal Knowledge OS

A web app where you upload your own documents (PDFs, notes, YouTube links) and chat with an AI that answers questions based specifically on your content.

## Features

- **Workspaces** — Organize documents into isolated projects (e.g. "Biology 101", "Startup Ideas")
- **Document Ingestion** — Supports PDFs, text files, and YouTube URLs
- **RAG** — AI retrieves relevant chunks from your documents before answering
- **Citations** — Every answer links back to the exact page or timestamp in the source
